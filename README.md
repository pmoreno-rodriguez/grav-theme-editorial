## Installation

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/cli-console/grav-cli-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

This will install the Editorial theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/editorial`.

### Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `editorial`.
